# DELETE LINES THE LINES 1 to 10 :
# 0.This is an exercise where a diff file is created to indicate the differences between two files, 'a' and 'b'. And the difference is saved in 'b'.
# What we need? The command 'diff', compares two files line by line. We must indicate if there is any difference between the two files. I assume that file 'a' contains more information than file 'b'. To know if there is any difference we have to:

pomesio@ diff -u b a > sw.diff
pomesio@ patch < sw.diff

# The command "diff -u b a > sw.diff" creates a unified (-u) diff file called sw.diff that shows the differences between files b and a.
# Why 'patch'? This command applies "sw.diff" to "b", which means that the modifications specified in "sw.diff" will be applied to the file "b".
